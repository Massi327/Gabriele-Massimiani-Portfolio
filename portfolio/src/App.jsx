            During my years at the Politecnico di

          <p className='p'>
            I had the chance to take part in 5+ projects in
            which I explored multiple roles such as
            producer, project coordinator, and
            programmer. <br/> This had been important to
            test how to work in a team, manage time
            better, make a budget plan and how to
            make a good pitch.
          </p>
          <p className='p'>
            I am an organised, precise and goal-oriented person, and I
            always give my best. <br/> I would like to work
            in the video game market, which I follow
            as an enthusiast and user, but I am open
            to jobs that allow me to test my skills and
            learn more and more.
